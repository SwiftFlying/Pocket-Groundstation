# Pocket-Groundstation
An attempt to create a mini ground station that will accept any Fatshark module.

<b>Ideas so far:</b></br>
• takes 2S to 4S voltage</br>
• 3,5mm AV output</br>
• RJ45 output for power+AV (only one wire to goggles) - constant 8V output on any power source (to stay compatible with fan-mod)</br>
• Powerswitch</br>
• Switch to toggle between DVR output (to adjust settings or review footage) or direct module output</br>

• Bonus (help required): low-voltage alarm and cell autodetection (adjustable via OLED, so it can work with lipo or li-ion batteries)</br>
• Bonus (help required): DRV-control via OLED (Eachine Pro DVR)</br>
• Bonus (help required): OSD overlay in the videofeed for GS battery status – probably with minimosd micro</br></br>

Many problems to solve! If you want to join the project or contribute, you are very welcome to do so!</br>
I will need any help I can get to solve the things involving coding (marked as BONUS)
