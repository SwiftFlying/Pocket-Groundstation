# Pocket-Groundstation
An attempt to create a mini ground station that will accept any Fatshark module.

Ideas so far:
• takes 2S to 4S voltage
• 3,5mm AV output
• RJ45 output for power+AV (only one wire to goggles) - constant 8V output on any power source (to stay compatible with fan-mod)
• Powerswitch
• Switch to toggle between DVR output (to adjust settings or review footage) or direct module output

• Bonus: low-voltage alarm and cell autodetection (adjustable via OLED, so it can work with lipo or li-ion batteries)
• Bonus: DRV-control via OLED (Eachine Pro DVR)
• Bonus: OSD overlay in the videofeed for GS battery status – probably with minimosd micro

Many problems to solve! If you want to join the project contribute, you are very welcome to do so!
I will need any help I can get to solve the things involving coding (marked as BONUS)
